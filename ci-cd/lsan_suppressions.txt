# LeakSanitizer suppression file for c2pa-c tests.
#
# On first use Tokio allocates process-global singleton state (signal handler
# registry, thread-local handles via OnceLock/Lazy) that is intentionally never
# freed. The allocation is bounded, does not grow, and is reclaimed by the OS on process exit.
#
# Observed on Ubuntu 22.04 aarch64 where LSan classifies the allocation as a
# "direct leak" rather than "still reachable".
#
# Similar if not same as https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio/issues/4756
# Happens only on some Linxues as it depends on the OS/glibc version too it seems!
